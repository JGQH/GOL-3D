## Introduction
This project is to practice with Tree JS for 3D elements (Since 3D with only CSS looks far away from my capabilities) by showing an animation for Conway's Game Of Life.

In 2D, the default would be B3/S23 (\[Cells are\] born if surrounded by 3 cells, survive if surrounded by 2 or 3, die or remain dead otherwise), but for this 3D version it will be B45/S55 (Considering surrounding cells as "C", a cell will be born if *4 <= C <= 5*, survives if *5 <= C <= 5*, and dies or remains dead otherwise).

## Technologies
-NodeJS v16.1.0
